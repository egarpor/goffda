\title{AEMET daily temperatures during 1974--2013}
\format{
A list with the following entries:
\describe{
  \item{temp}{an \code{\link[fda.usc]{fdata}} with 2892 temperature
  (in Celsius degrees) curves, discretized on 365 equispaced
  grid points (days) on \eqn{[0.5, 364.5]}. Each curve corresponds to the
  yearly records of a weather station.}
  \item{df}{a dataframe with metadata for each curve:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{ind}: identifier of the weather station.}
    \item{\code{name}: name of the weather station.}
    \item{\code{year}: year of the observation.}
  }}
}
}
\source{
The data was retrieved from the FTP of the
\href{http://www.aemet.es/es/portada/}{Meteorological State Agency of Spain
(AEMET)} in 2014 using a processing script by the authors of the
\code{\link[fda.usc]{fda.usc-package}}.

\description{
Series of daily temperatures of 73 Spanish weather stations
during the 40-year period 1974--2013.
}
\details{
For consistency with the \code{\link[fda.usc]{fda.usc-package}}'s
\code{\link[fda.usc]{aemet}} dataset, the names and identifiers of the 73
weather stations are the same as in that dataset. Only a minor fix has been
applied to the "A CORUÑA/ALVEDRO" station, whose identifier was the same
as the "A CORUÑA" station, \code{"1387"}. The former was set to
\code{"1387A"}.

Information about the province, altitude, longitude, and latitude of
each weather station can be retrieved in \code{df} from the
\code{\link[fda.usc]{fda.usc-package}}'s \code{\link[fda.usc]{aemet}}
dataset.

The dataset is a curated version of a larger database of 115 stations. It
excludes stations with inconsistent records or that were relocated, closed,
or opened during the 40-year period. There are 9 stations with missing
years. The total of missing years is 28.

In leap years, the daily-average temperature is computed as the average of
February 28th and 29th.
